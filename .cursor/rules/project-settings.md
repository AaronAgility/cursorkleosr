```

## Critical Patterns & Conventions
- Use Agility CMS content models and page management patterns
- **Image Optimization**: Always use AgilityPic component (promoted over AgilityImage)
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions when using Next.js
- Use hierarchical Phase > Task > SubTask organization for development workflow
- All user interactions must be non-blocking through interaction component system
- Maintain production-ready code standards with no TODOs or placeholders
- Follow semantic Git commit patterns with GitSHA tracking
- Implement proper TypeScript types for Agility CMS content models

## Agility CMS Best Practices
- **Content Fetching**: Use Fetch SDK for client-side, Sync SDK for build-time
- **Image Optimization**: Always use AgilityPic component for images (not AgilityImage)
- **Page Routing**: Leverage Agility's page management for dynamic routing
- **Content Models**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all content models
- **Preview Mode**: Implement proper preview functionality for content editors
- **SEO**: Use Agility's SEO fields and meta data management
- **Performance**: Implement proper caching strategies for content
- **Documentation**: Reference specific SDK files for focused implementation guidance

## SDK Documentation Usage Patterns
### **Common Development Tasks**
- **Content fetching**: `fetch-sdk/content-operations.md#content-lists`
- **Dynamic pages**: `next-sdk/data-fetching.md#dynamic-page-generation`
- **Custom fields**: `apps-sdk/custom-fields.md#react-custom-field-example`
- **Content management**: `management-sdk/content-operations.md#create-content`
- **Build-time sync**: `sync-sdk/sync-operations.md#content-sync`

### **Integration Patterns**
- **Next.js + Agility**: `next-sdk/app-router-setup.md`
- **React + Custom Fields**: `apps-sdk/custom-fields.md`
- **GraphQL queries**: `fetch-sdk/advanced-features.md#graphql-support`
- **Multi-language**: `fetch-sdk/advanced-features.md#multi-language-support`

## Constraints
- Files should not exceed archiving thresholds to maintain editability
- User interaction responses must be handled through tool calls
- All archived content must maintain semantic references
- Must maintain compatibility with Agility CMS content structure
- Framework choice should be confirmed before major architectural decisions
- SDK documentation references should use specific file paths for optimal LLM retrieval

## Git Workflow Settings
- **Default Branch:** main
- **Feature Branch Prefix:** feature/
- **Phase Commit Pattern:** "Phase {phase_number}: {description}"
- **Code Revision Frequency:** Every 3-5 phases
- **Commit Modes:** insanity (auto-commit) | always-ask (prompt for approval)
- **Default Mode:** See .cursorrules Default Mode setting

## User Interaction System
- **Interaction Mode:** Non-blocking tool-call based
- **Response Timeout:** Configured in .cursorrules per interaction type
- **Interaction History:** Stored in workflow_state.md
- **Timeout Actions:** Continue (apply default) or Wait (pause workflow)
- **Defaults Reference:** See .cursorrules for complete interaction defaults

## Archiving System Settings
- **Archive Directory:** .cursor/archive/
- **File Size Threshold:** 15,000 characters
- **Archive Naming Pattern:** {filename}-{timestamp}.md
- **Archive Trigger:** Automatic on file size or manual
- **Reference Preservation:** Maintain GitSHA and phase references in archived files

## Tokenization Settings
- Estimated chars-per-token: 3.5  
- Max tokens per message: 8,000
- Archive when **workflow_state.md** exceeds 15K chars
- Archive when **project-settings.md** exceeds 12K chars

## Phase History
<!-- GitSHA references for semantic memory -->
| Phase | GitSHA | Description | Date | Archive Ref |
|-------|--------|-------------|------|-------------|

### **MCP Integration Usage**

With Figma and Playwright MCPs configured in Cursor, use natural language commands:

**Figma Design Integration:**
- `"Extract design tokens from the Figma file and generate a Tailwind config"`
- `"Generate React components from the hero section in Figma"`
- `"Create AgilityPic-optimized components from the gallery design"`

**Playwright Testing:**
- `"Create tests for the blog listing page with Agility CMS content"`
- `"Generate performance tests for Core Web Vitals compliance"`
- `"Create visual regression tests for the hero component"`

**Combined Workflows:**
- `"Extract Figma tokens, generate components, and create tests"`
- `"Build complete design-to-code pipeline with testing"`
- `"Validate entire application with comprehensive test suite"`
